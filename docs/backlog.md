# KNXVault Backlog

Actionable backlog derived from [`docs/lld.md`](lld.md). Items are **topologically sorted by dependency** — implement in listed order within each phase.

**Legend**

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **ID** | `W#-##` = work item (dependency order within phase) |
| **Effort** | S (< 1 day) · M (1–3 days) · L (3–7 days) · XL (> 1 week) |
| **Area** | ci · crypto · storage · api · auth · k8s · docs · security |
| **Depends on** | Prior backlog IDs that must be complete first |

## Storage backend (architecture pivot)

**Target backend:** [Dragonboat](https://github.com/lni/dragonboat) — a multi-group Raft consensus library in Go. Vault state (CAs, secrets, audit, RBAC, leases, revocations, issued certs) is replicated through a **Raft state machine** instead of an external PostgreSQL database.

| Aspect | Previous (interim) | Target (Dragonboat) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Persistence | PostgreSQL + SQL migrations | Raft log + Pebble (default Dragonboat WAL) + state-machine snapshots |
| HA / consistency | External Postgres operator + K8s Lease for jobs | Built-in Raft quorum; leader derived from Raft role |
| Dev / single-node | In-memory repos when `KNXVAULT_DATABASE_URL` unset | Single-node Raft cluster or dev-mode state machine |
| Backup | Encrypted JSON snapshot over SQL tables | Dragonboat snapshots + existing encrypted export API |

Phases 1–2 below were implemented against the **interim PostgreSQL backend** and remain valid as application-layer work. **Phase 3** replaces the storage/HA substrate; repository interfaces (`internal/repository/interfaces.go`) are kept — implementations move from `postgres/` to `dragonboat/`.

> **Note:** LLD §4.D still describes PostgreSQL; update LLD in W23-02 when the Dragonboat design is finalized.

## Phase 3 — Dragonboat storage backend (complete)

Replace PostgreSQL and K8s Lease–based HA with an embedded [Dragonboat](https://github.com/lni/dragonboat) Raft cluster. Default log store: Pebble (Dragonboat default). Repository interfaces unchanged; new implementations live under `internal/repository/dragonboat/` and `internal/raft/`.

| ID | Title | Area | Effort | Depends on | Description | Acceptance criteria |
|----|-------|------|--------|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| ~~**W23-01**~~ | ~~Dragonboat dependency & license gate~~ | ci | S | W2-02 | Add `github.com/lni/dragonboat/v3` (or v4 when stable), SPDX check in `config/licenses.allow`, `go mod tidy` clean. | Done — `github.com/lni/dragonboat/v3@v3.3.8`; `make licenses` passes. |
| ~~**W23-02**~~ | ~~Dragonboat storage design doc~~ | docs | M | W23-01 | Update LLD §4.D / §8.3: Raft group layout, command catalog, snapshot format, Pebble data dirs, single-node vs 3-node topology. | Done — [`docs/storage/dragonboat.md`](storage/dragonboat.md). |
| ~~**W24-01**~~ | ~~NodeHost bootstrap & config~~ | storage | M | W23-01 | `internal/raft/nodehost.go`: `NodeHost` lifecycle, `KNXVAULT_RAFT_*` config (node ID, peers, data dir, election RTT). | Server starts with Raft enabled; `/ready` reports `raft_ready` + `leader`. |
| ~~**W24-02**~~ | ~~Vault state machine skeleton~~ | storage | M | W24-01 | `internal/raft/statemachine.go` implementing `statemachine.IStateMachine`: `Update`, `Lookup`, `SaveSnapshot`, `RecoverFromSnapshot`. | Unit tests apply noop commands; snapshot round-trip passes. |
| ~~**W25-01**~~ | ~~State machine — core entities~~ | storage | L | W24-02, W4-03 | Commands for CA, secret versions, audit append (hash chain), revocations. Dragonboat repo adapters implement `repository.*` interfaces. | PKI + KV + audit integration tests pass on single-node Raft. |
| ~~**W25-02**~~ | ~~State machine — Phase 2 entities~~ | storage | M | W25-01 | Commands for leases, policies, roles, database roles, issued certificates. | Dynamic secrets + RBAC persistence tests pass on Raft. |
| ~~**W26-01**~~ | ~~Wire Dragonboat into `app/deps`~~ | storage | M | W25-02 | Replace `postgres.NewPool` path with Raft repos when `KNXVAULT_RAFT_ENABLED=true`; keep memory mode for tests. Deprecate `KNXVAULT_DATABASE_URL` as primary backend. | `make test` passes; server runs without PostgreSQL. |
| ~~**W26-02**~~ | ~~Raft leader for background jobs~~ | k8s | M | W26-01, W15-02 | Gate `JobRunner` on Dragonboat leader ID instead of K8s Lease when Raft enabled; expose `knxvault_raft_leader` metric. | Only Raft leader runs lease cleanup / CRL refresh / cert renewal. |
| ~~**W27-01**~~ | ~~Dragonboat snapshot backup~~ | storage | M | W26-01, W21-01 | Integrate Dragonboat `SaveSnapshot` / on-disk snapshots with `POST /sys/backup`; restore via `RecoverFromSnapshot` + state machine import. | Backup/restore round-trip on 3-node cluster without PostgreSQL. |
| ~~**W27-02**~~ | ~~PostgreSQL → Dragonboat migration tool~~ | storage | M | W26-01 | One-shot CLI/API: read existing Postgres snapshot (W21 export) or live DSN, propose Raft commands to seed cluster. | Documented migration runbook; test on sample data. |
| ~~**W28-01**~~ | ~~3-node Raft integration tests~~ | ci | L | W26-01 | `test/integration/raft_*`: 3 processes or docker-compose with distinct `KNXVAULT_RAFT_NODE_ID` / peer lists; verify linearizable writes and leader failover. | `make test-integration` includes Raft suite. |
| ~~**W28-02**~~ | ~~Kubernetes StatefulSet manifests~~ | k8s | M | W24-01 | Replace Deployment+Lease with StatefulSet, headless Service, PVC per replica, `KNXVAULT_RAFT_INITIAL_MEMBERS` ConfigMap. | `docs/deploy/kubernetes.md` updated; 3-replica Raft deploy verified. |
| ~~**W29-01**~~ | ~~Deprecate PostgreSQL backend~~ | storage | S | W28-01 | Mark `internal/repository/postgres` deprecated; remove `docker-compose.test.yml` Postgres service; drop `KNXVAULT_DATABASE_URL` from default manifests. | README lists Dragonboat as required backend; Postgres path optional/legacy. |
| ~~**W29-02**~~ | ~~Observability for Raft~~ | docs | S | W26-02, W22-01 | Prometheus: Raft term, leader, commit index, propose latency; Grafana panel additions. | `docs/metrics.md` + dashboard JSON updated. |

### Phase 3 — configuration (target)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_ENABLED` | `true` | Use Dragonboat backend (false = in-memory dev only) |
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_NODE_ID` | `1` | Raft node ID (unique per replica) |
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_DATA_DIR` | `/var/lib/knxvault/raft` | Pebble WAL + snapshot directory |
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_INITIAL_MEMBERS` | _(required in HA)_ | Comma-separated `id=host:port` peer list |
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_ELECTION_RTT` | `10` | Election RTT (Dragonboat tuning) |
| `KNXVAULT_RAFT_HEARTBEAT_RTT` | `1` | Heartbeat RTT |

| **W31-02** | PKCS#11 HSM integration | crypto | L | W31-01 | HSM-backed CA key generation via OpenSSL engine. | Root CA created on SoftHSM; documented config. |

| **W34-01** | Server mTLS | security | M | W5-03 | TLS with client certificate requirement on secured routes. | mTLS handshake test; opt-in flag. |
| **W34-02** | Client cert issuance API | security | M | W34-01 | PKI role for API consumer certificates. | Issue + authenticate with client cert. |

| **W35-02** | Compliance audit packs | docs | M | W14 | Exportable audit bundles for compliance evidence. | Pack generation CLI command. |

## Long-term future

Deferred packaging and ecosystem work — not scheduled for Phase 1 MVP.

| Item | Area | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Terraform provider** | docs | Infrastructure-as-code integration deferred; not a near-term focus. Revisit after Phase 4 ecosystem items stabilize. |
| **Helm chart** | k8s | Install UX and values templating deferred until core API, auth, and raw K8s deploy path are stable. Target: post–Phase 1 (Phase 2+). See LLD §6.1 for intended chart structure. |
| Helm hooks (pre-upgrade backup) | k8s | Depends on Helm chart. |
| Grafana dashboards bundled in chart | docs | Depends on Helm chart + W10 metrics. |
